% Abstract (Do not use inserted blank lines, i.e. \\)
\abstract{Everyone knows that \texttt{bookdown} is an excellent package for authoring books on programming languages. But it is only one side of the coin. It can do more than expected. Therefore I am developing \texttt{bookdownplus}. \texttt{bookdownplus} is an extension of \texttt{bookdown}. It helps you write academic journal articles, guitar books, chemical equations, mails, calendars, and diaries.}
