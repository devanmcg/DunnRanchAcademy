\begin{table} 
	\sidecaption[Variability \& manageability of the three components of the fire behaviour triangle]{
		The three components of the fire behaviour triangle\textemdash topography, weather, and fuel\textemdash in terms of their variability and capacity to be managed. 
		The table mostly considers the spatial scale of a single burn unit over which the same general weather patterns apply.
		Thus the manageability of weather refers to broad decisions as to whether to ignite a prescribed burn, or the direction firefighters might begin their operations. 
		Topography is fixed through time. 
		Fuels are variable in both time and space, depending on vegetation and interactions with weather. 
		Fuels are also the easiest to alter via management.
