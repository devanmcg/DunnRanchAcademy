  abstract = {Rangeland scientists have long relied on thermocouples for measuring temperature, especially in agris—in the field, under the extreme conditions of wildland fire. But the electronics required to sense and record thermocouple data remain expensive to both purchase and protect from exposure to heat and flames. Open-source, do-it-yourself (DIY) electronics platforms such as Arduino are increasingly popular among ecologists, and have been shown to perform as well as proprietary commercial systems when recording thermocouple data. The FeatherFlame system is a reliable, low-cost solution to sampling wildland fire, ranging from US\$240–490 for 1–6 thermocouple sensors, including all fire protection equipment. The low cost and multi-sensor capacity facilitates spatial replication, which allows fire ecologists to measure and report meaningful data on rate of spread and calculate fire intensity.},

  abstract = {Emissions from open vegetation ﬁres contribute signiﬁcantly to global atmospheric dynamics. However, the value of improved quantiﬁcation of areas burned and knowledge of the composition and structure of biomass fuel is compromised in current emissions modelling and measurement by inadequate understanding of the chemistry of biomass combustion. Physical models of the behaviour of open vegetation ﬁres also have relied on over-simpliﬁed combustion chemistry. Considerable knowledge of the thermal degradation and combustion of cellulose, the major constituent of the terrestrial biomass, exists but has yet to make an impact in the ﬁelds of atmospheric emissions monitoring and open vegetation ﬁre behaviour modelling. This article provides an interpretive summary of the current knowledge of the chemistry and dynamics of the processes of thermal degradation and combustion of cellulosic biomass and discusses the role of these processes in determining the emissions from, and behaviour of, open ﬁres in such fuels. The important role of competitive thermal decomposition is emphasised, as a driver and regulator of emissions and ﬁre spread (short-term, local effects) and global carbon distributions (longterm, global effects).},

  abstract = {We explore the basis of understanding wildland fire behaviour with the intention of stimulating curiosity and promoting fundamental investigations of fire spread problems that persist even in the presence of tremendous modelling advances. Internationally, many fire models have been developed based on a variety of assumptions and expressions for the fundamental heat transfer and combustion processes. The diversity of these assumptions raises the question as to whether the absence of a sound and coherent fire spread theory is partly responsible. We explore the thesis that, without a common understanding of what processes occur and how they occur, model reliability cannot be confirmed. A theory is defined as a collection of logically connected hypotheses that provide a coherent explanation of some aspect of reality. Models implement theory for a particular purpose, including hypotheses of phenomena and practical uses, such as prediction. We emphasise the need for theory and demonstrate the difference between theory and modelling. Increasingly sophisticated fire management requires modelling capabilities well beyond the fundamental basis of current models. These capabilities can only be met with fundamental fire behaviour research. Furthermore, possibilities as well as limitations for modelling may not be known or knowable without first having the theory.},

  abstract = {Roughly 3\% of the Earth’s land surface burns annually, representing a critical exchange of energy and matter between the land and atmosphere via combustion. Fires range from slow smouldering peat ﬁres, to low-intensity surface ﬁres, to intense crown ﬁres, depending on vegetation structure, fuel moisture, prevailing climate, and weather conditions. While the links between biogeochemistry, climate and ﬁre are widely studied within Earth system science, these relationships are also mediated by fuels—namely plants and their litter—that are the product of evolutionary and ecological processes. Fire is a powerful selective force and, over their evolutionary history, plants have evolved traits that both tolerate and promote ﬁre numerous times and across diverse clades. Here we outline a conceptual framework of how plant traits determine the ﬂammability of ecosystems and interact with climate and weather to inﬂuence ﬁre regimes. We explore how these evolutionary and ecological processes scale to impact biogeochemical and Earth system processes. Finally, we outline several research challenges that, when resolved, will improve our understanding of the role of plant evolution in mediating the ﬁre feedbacks driving Earth system processes. Understanding current patterns of ﬁre and vegetation, as well as patterns of ﬁre over geological time, requires research that incorporates evolutionary biology, ecology, biogeography, and the biogeosciences.},

  abstract = {An experimental study was conducted to understand the intermittent heating behavior downstream of a gaseous line burner under forced flow conditions. While previous studies have addressed time-averaged properties, here measurements of the flame location and intermittent heat flux profile help to give a time-dependent picture of downstream heating from the flame, useful for understanding wind-driven flame spread. Two frequencies are extracted from experiments, the maximum flame forward pulsation frequency in the direction of the wind, which helps describe the motion of the flame, and the local flame-fuel contact frequency in the flame region, which is useful in calculating the actual heat flux that can be received by the unburnt fuel via direct flame contact. The forward pulsation frequency is obtained through video analysis using a variable interval time average (VITA) method. Scaling analysis indicates that the flame forward pulsation frequency varies as a power-law function of the Froude number and fire heat-release rate, <mml:math id="M1" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>f</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>F</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mover accent="true"><mml:mrow><mml:mtext> </mml:mtext></mml:mrow><mml:mo>~</mml:mo></mml:mover><mml:msup><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mo stretchy="true">(</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mi>F</mml:mi><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mo>/</mml:mo><mml:msup><mml:mrow><mml:msup><mml:mrow><mml:mi>Q</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mo>*</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:msup></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mo>/</mml:mo><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msup></mml:mrow><mml:mo stretchy="true">)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>0</mml:mn><mml:mo>.</mml:mo><mml:mn>4</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msup></mml:math>.

  abstract = {A detailed experimental investigation of turbulent diffusion flames under forced flow was conducted to study local heat fluxes to a nearly adiabatic surface downstream of a gaseous line burner. A variety of ambient wind velocities and fuel flow rates were employed to study different fire scenarios modeling the dynamics of wind-driven fire spread as found in wildland, mine or tunnel fires. The downstream heat flux distribution was correlated as a piecewise function with the Richardson number in two regimes, the first with higher heat fluxes, where the flame remained attached the downstream surface (attached region) and the second with a steeper decay of heat fluxes (plume region). Analysis of the heat flux distribution revealed that local heat fluxes roughly reach a maximum where the Richardson number equaled unity. This was thought to be a good marker of the regime where the flame detaches from the surface, e.g. where buoyancy from the flame overcomes inertial forces from the oncoming flow. This observation was further corroborated by analysis of side-view images of the flame, which showed the attachment location was linearly correlated with the location where the Richardson number equaled unity. The results from this study suggest that local heat flux values reach a maximum at the transition between a momentum-dominated (attached, wind-driven) to buoyancydominated (plume or fire) regime in forced flow scenarios. The results have interesting implications to the problem of flame attachment, which is known to accelerate fire spread in both inclined and wind-driven fire scenarios.},

  abstract   = {The complex interactions between the inclined terrain and the ﬂow generated by the ﬁre make the slope one of the most inﬂuencing factors on ﬁre spread. In order to gain a deeper understanding of the mechanisms involved in wildﬁres spreading upslope, the investigation of ﬂow dynamics and heat transfers is fundamental. This paper reports a series of ﬁre spread experiments conducted across a porous bed of excelsior in a large-scale facility, under both no-slope and 30° up-slope conditions. The coupling of particle image velocimetry and video imaging allowed characterizing the ﬂow pattern with respect to the ﬁre front. Simultaneous heat ﬂux measurements with high scan rate were also performed at the edge of the fuel bed. From the collected data, the increase of the rate of spread with increasing slope is attributed to a major change in ﬂuid dynamics surrounding the ﬂame. For horizontal ﬁre spread, ﬂame fronts exhibit quasi-vertical plume resulting from the buoyancy forces generated by the ﬁre. These buoyancy effects induce an inward ﬂow of ambient air that is entrained laterally into the ﬁre from both sides. Flame radiation is the dominant fuel preheating mechanism. Under upslope conditions, the ﬁre plume is tilted toward the unburnt vegetation, increasing radiation levels. The air entrainment at the burnt side of the ﬁre strongly inﬂuences the downstream ﬂow, which becomes attached to the surface over a characteristic length scale. Ahead of the ﬂame front, the induced wind blows away from the ﬁre rather than toward it, enhancing convective heating. Periodical forward bursts of ﬂame combined with distant fuel ignitions were also observed. The heat ﬂux measurements conﬁrmed the existence of such convective mechanisms. © 2017 The Combustion Institute. Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

To address this deficiency, we burned constructed fuelbeds from masticated sites in pine flatwoods forests in northern Florida with palmetto-dominated understoreys and examined the effects of fuel load and fuel moisture content (FMC) on fire behaviour. Flame lengths (49–140 cm) and fireline intensity (183–773 kJ mÀ1 sÀ1) increased with loading (10–30 Mg haÀ1) and were reduced by 40 and 47\% with increasing FMC from 9 to 13\%. Rate of spread was not influenced by fuel load, but doubled under drier FMC. Fuel consumption was .90\% for all burns. Soil temperatures were influenced by both fuel load and FMC, but never reached lethal temperatures (608C). However, temperatures of thermocouple probes placed at the fuelbed surface reached 274–5038C. Probe maximum temperature and duration at temperatures \$608C (9.5–20.08C min) both increased with fuel load, but were unaffected by FMC. The fire behaviour observed in these unique litter-dominated fuelbeds provides additional insight into the burning characteristics of masticated fuels in general.},
