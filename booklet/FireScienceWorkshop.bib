  abstract = {Rangeland scientists have long relied on thermocouples for measuring temperature, especially in agris—in the field, under the extreme conditions of wildland fire. But the electronics required to sense and record thermocouple data remain expensive to both purchase and protect from exposure to heat and flames. Open-source, do-it-yourself (DIY) electronics platforms such as Arduino are increasingly popular among ecologists, and have been shown to perform as well as proprietary commercial systems when recording thermocouple data. The FeatherFlame system is a reliable, low-cost solution to sampling wildland fire, ranging from US\$240–490 for 1–6 thermocouple sensors, including all fire protection equipment. The low cost and multi-sensor capacity facilitates spatial replication, which allows fire ecologists to measure and report meaningful data on rate of spread and calculate fire intensity.},

  abstract = {Emissions from open vegetation ﬁres contribute signiﬁcantly to global atmospheric dynamics. However, the value of improved quantiﬁcation of areas burned and knowledge of the composition and structure of biomass fuel is compromised in current emissions modelling and measurement by inadequate understanding of the chemistry of biomass combustion. Physical models of the behaviour of open vegetation ﬁres also have relied on over-simpliﬁed combustion chemistry. Considerable knowledge of the thermal degradation and combustion of cellulose, the major constituent of the terrestrial biomass, exists but has yet to make an impact in the ﬁelds of atmospheric emissions monitoring and open vegetation ﬁre behaviour modelling. This article provides an interpretive summary of the current knowledge of the chemistry and dynamics of the processes of thermal degradation and combustion of cellulosic biomass and discusses the role of these processes in determining the emissions from, and behaviour of, open ﬁres in such fuels. The important role of competitive thermal decomposition is emphasised, as a driver and regulator of emissions and ﬁre spread (short-term, local effects) and global carbon distributions (longterm, global effects).},

  abstract = {We explore the basis of understanding wildland fire behaviour with the intention of stimulating curiosity and promoting fundamental investigations of fire spread problems that persist even in the presence of tremendous modelling advances. Internationally, many fire models have been developed based on a variety of assumptions and expressions for the fundamental heat transfer and combustion processes. The diversity of these assumptions raises the question as to whether the absence of a sound and coherent fire spread theory is partly responsible. We explore the thesis that, without a common understanding of what processes occur and how they occur, model reliability cannot be confirmed. A theory is defined as a collection of logically connected hypotheses that provide a coherent explanation of some aspect of reality. Models implement theory for a particular purpose, including hypotheses of phenomena and practical uses, such as prediction. We emphasise the need for theory and demonstrate the difference between theory and modelling. Increasingly sophisticated fire management requires modelling capabilities well beyond the fundamental basis of current models. These capabilities can only be met with fundamental fire behaviour research. Furthermore, possibilities as well as limitations for modelling may not be known or knowable without first having the theory.},

  abstract = {Roughly 3\% of the Earth’s land surface burns annually, representing a critical exchange of energy and matter between the land and atmosphere via combustion. Fires range from slow smouldering peat ﬁres, to low-intensity surface ﬁres, to intense crown ﬁres, depending on vegetation structure, fuel moisture, prevailing climate, and weather conditions. While the links between biogeochemistry, climate and ﬁre are widely studied within Earth system science, these relationships are also mediated by fuels—namely plants and their litter—that are the product of evolutionary and ecological processes. Fire is a powerful selective force and, over their evolutionary history, plants have evolved traits that both tolerate and promote ﬁre numerous times and across diverse clades. Here we outline a conceptual framework of how plant traits determine the ﬂammability of ecosystems and interact with climate and weather to inﬂuence ﬁre regimes. We explore how these evolutionary and ecological processes scale to impact biogeochemical and Earth system processes. Finally, we outline several research challenges that, when resolved, will improve our understanding of the role of plant evolution in mediating the ﬁre feedbacks driving Earth system processes. Understanding current patterns of ﬁre and vegetation, as well as patterns of ﬁre over geological time, requires research that incorporates evolutionary biology, ecology, biogeography, and the biogeosciences.},

  abstract = {An experimental study was conducted to understand the intermittent heating behavior downstream of a gaseous line burner under forced flow conditions. While previous studies have addressed time-averaged properties, here measurements of the flame location and intermittent heat flux profile help to give a time-dependent picture of downstream heating from the flame, useful for understanding wind-driven flame spread. Two frequencies are extracted from experiments, the maximum flame forward pulsation frequency in the direction of the wind, which helps describe the motion of the flame, and the local flame-fuel contact frequency in the flame region, which is useful in calculating the actual heat flux that can be received by the unburnt fuel via direct flame contact. The forward pulsation frequency is obtained through video analysis using a variable interval time average (VITA) method. Scaling analysis indicates that the flame forward pulsation frequency varies as a power-law function of the Froude number and fire heat-release rate, <mml:math id="M1" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>f</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>F</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mover accent="true"><mml:mrow><mml:mtext> </mml:mtext></mml:mrow><mml:mo>~</mml:mo></mml:mover><mml:msup><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mo stretchy="true">(</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mi>F</mml:mi><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mo>/</mml:mo><mml:msup><mml:mrow><mml:msup><mml:mrow><mml:mi>Q</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mo>*</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:msup></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mo>/</mml:mo><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msup></mml:mrow><mml:mo stretchy="true">)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>0</mml:mn><mml:mo>.</mml:mo><mml:mn>4</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msup></mml:math>.

  abstract = {A detailed experimental investigation of turbulent diffusion flames under forced flow was conducted to study local heat fluxes to a nearly adiabatic surface downstream of a gaseous line burner. A variety of ambient wind velocities and fuel flow rates were employed to study different fire scenarios modeling the dynamics of wind-driven fire spread as found in wildland, mine or tunnel fires. The downstream heat flux distribution was correlated as a piecewise function with the Richardson number in two regimes, the first with higher heat fluxes, where the flame remained attached the downstream surface (attached region) and the second with a steeper decay of heat fluxes (plume region). Analysis of the heat flux distribution revealed that local heat fluxes roughly reach a maximum where the Richardson number equaled unity. This was thought to be a good marker of the regime where the flame detaches from the surface, e.g. where buoyancy from the flame overcomes inertial forces from the oncoming flow. This observation was further corroborated by analysis of side-view images of the flame, which showed the attachment location was linearly correlated with the location where the Richardson number equaled unity. The results from this study suggest that local heat flux values reach a maximum at the transition between a momentum-dominated (attached, wind-driven) to buoyancydominated (plume or fire) regime in forced flow scenarios. The results have interesting implications to the problem of flame attachment, which is known to accelerate fire spread in both inclined and wind-driven fire scenarios.},

  abstract   = {The complex interactions between the inclined terrain and the ﬂow generated by the ﬁre make the slope one of the most inﬂuencing factors on ﬁre spread. In order to gain a deeper understanding of the mechanisms involved in wildﬁres spreading upslope, the investigation of ﬂow dynamics and heat transfers is fundamental. This paper reports a series of ﬁre spread experiments conducted across a porous bed of excelsior in a large-scale facility, under both no-slope and 30° up-slope conditions. The coupling of particle image velocimetry and video imaging allowed characterizing the ﬂow pattern with respect to the ﬁre front. Simultaneous heat ﬂux measurements with high scan rate were also performed at the edge of the fuel bed. From the collected data, the increase of the rate of spread with increasing slope is attributed to a major change in ﬂuid dynamics surrounding the ﬂame. For horizontal ﬁre spread, ﬂame fronts exhibit quasi-vertical plume resulting from the buoyancy forces generated by the ﬁre. These buoyancy effects induce an inward ﬂow of ambient air that is entrained laterally into the ﬁre from both sides. Flame radiation is the dominant fuel preheating mechanism. Under upslope conditions, the ﬁre plume is tilted toward the unburnt vegetation, increasing radiation levels. The air entrainment at the burnt side of the ﬁre strongly inﬂuences the downstream ﬂow, which becomes attached to the surface over a characteristic length scale. Ahead of the ﬂame front, the induced wind blows away from the ﬁre rather than toward it, enhancing convective heating. Periodical forward bursts of ﬂame combined with distant fuel ignitions were also observed. The heat ﬂux measurements conﬁrmed the existence of such convective mechanisms. © 2017 The Combustion Institute. Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

To address this deficiency, we burned constructed fuelbeds from masticated sites in pine flatwoods forests in northern Florida with palmetto-dominated understoreys and examined the effects of fuel load and fuel moisture content (FMC) on fire behaviour. Flame lengths (49–140 cm) and fireline intensity (183–773 kJ mÀ1 sÀ1) increased with loading (10–30 Mg haÀ1) and were reduced by 40 and 47\% with increasing FMC from 9 to 13\%. Rate of spread was not influenced by fuel load, but doubled under drier FMC. Fuel consumption was .90\% for all burns. Soil temperatures were influenced by both fuel load and FMC, but never reached lethal temperatures (608C). However, temperatures of thermocouple probes placed at the fuelbed surface reached 274–5038C. Probe maximum temperature and duration at temperatures \$608C (9.5–20.08C min) both increased with fuel load, but were unaffected by FMC. The fire behaviour observed in these unique litter-dominated fuelbeds provides additional insight into the burning characteristics of masticated fuels in general.},

  abstract = {Summer droughts in North America’s northern Great Plains are expected to increase in frequency and duration as precipitation shifts toward spring and fall. Two rangeland experimental stations in North Dakota experienced drought in 2017 relative to 25-year averages. The southwest location had a 170-mm deﬁcit from the 360-mm normal rainfall and was grazed by cattle (Bos taurus L.) and sheep (Ovis aries L.); the south-central location had 109 mm below the 403-mm normal rainfall and was grazed by cattle. We evaluated patch-burn grazing as a drought resilient land management strategy in the northern Great Plains by comparing average daily gains, fecal density, available forage biomass, and forage crude protein content. At the southwest location, livestock performed better during the drought season compared with animals on the same pastures in the previous year, which had near-normal rainfall but no ﬁre. At the central location, cows on patch-burned pastures performed better than cows on continuously-grazed, unburned pastures in the same year under drought conditions; all cows were nursing calves and calf gains did not vary between treatments. In both locations, the burned patches had higher fecal density and lower available forage biomass than patches not yet burned throughout the grazing season, indicating grazer attraction to burned areas. Despite drought, burned patches maintained grazer attraction and animal performance was maintained or even improved, which contrasts with the expected relationship between animal performance and precipitation. This study indicated that prescribed patch-burning might mitigate drought by buffering forage resources (crude protein content and availability) and maintaining animal performance (average daily gains).},

  abstract = {Ecological disturbances frequently control the occurrence and patterning of dominant plants in high-diversity communities like C4 grasslands and savannas. In such ecosystems disturbance-related processes can have important implications for species, and for whole communities when those species are dominant, yet mechanistic understanding of such processes remains fragmentary. Multiple bunchgrass species commonly co-dominate disturbance-dependent and species-rich pine savannas, where small-scale fuel heterogeneity may influence bunchgrass survival and growth following fires. We quantified how fire in locally varying fuel loads influenced dynamics of dominant C4 bunchgrasses in a species-rich pine savanna in southeastern Louisiana, USA. We focused on two congeneric, co-dominant species (Schizachyrium scoparium and S. tenerum) with similar growth forms, functional traits and reproductive strategies to highlight effects of fuel heterogeneity during fires. In experimental plots with either reduced or increased fuels versus controls with unmanipulated fuels, we compared: 1) bunchgrass damage and 2) mortality from fires; 3) subsequent growth and 4) flowering. Compared to controls, fire with increased fuels caused greater damage, mortality and subsequent flowering, but did not affect post-fire growth. Fire with reduced fuels had no effect on any of the four measures. The two species responded differently to fire with increased fuels – S. scoparium incurred measurably more damage and mortality than S. tenerum. Logistic regression indicated that the larger average size of S. tenerum tussocks made them resistant to more severe burning where fuels were increased. We speculate that locally increased fuel loading may be important in pine savannas for creating colonization sites because where fuels are light or moderate, dominant bunchgrasses persist through fires. Small-scale heterogeneity in fires, and differences in how species tolerate fire may together promote shared local dominance by different bunchgrasses.},

  abstract = {An understanding of fire behaviour and its impacts on natural ecosystems is essential for developing management strategies, specifically for planning prescribed fires. It is well known that vegetation and microclimate factors are important predictors of fire behaviour. However, the relative importance of these factors and how fire behaviour responds to changes in these factors are still understood, especially in the Brazilian Cerrado, which has strong seasonality and high vegetation heterogeneity. Here, we compiled literature data from 65 experimental fire plots in three vegetation types in the Cerrado biome—grasslands, savannas, and forests—corresponding to a gradient of increasing of woody cover. First, we evaluated how aspects of fire behaviour (fire spread rate, fire intensity, and heat released) and of fire-associated emissions (fine fuel consumption, combustion factor, and carbon emissions associated with fine fuel consumption) vary according to vegetation type. Subsequently, we evaluated the relative importance of vegetation (represented by woody cover and fine fuel load) and microclimatic factors (represented by vapour pressure deficit [VPD] and wind speed) in determining the fire behaviour and fire-associated emissions. Using generalised linear models, we evaluated the simultaneous influences of vegetation and microclimate variables (only for independent and non-collinear variables) on fire behaviour and fire-associated emissions. We found that aspects of fire behaviour and fire-associated emissions differed among the vegetation types: compared to forests, grasslands and savannas showed higher fire spread rates and fire intensities, consumed more fine fuel biomass, had larger combustion factors, released more heat, and emitted more carbon. The results show that the vegetation type, VPD and fine fuel load are key metrics for explain fire behaviour and fire-associated emissions in the Cerrado. The VPD was found to be the primary driver of the fire spread rate and fire intensity for all vegetation types and fine fuel load was the primary driver of heat released, fine fuel consumption, combustion factor, and carbon emissions in all vegetation types.},

  abstract = {Fire is critical to the maintenance of ecological function in many ecosystems worldwide, especially mesic sub-Saharan rangelands. But most rangeland fire research occurs in a wildfire context, is focused on fire effects, or simply assumes that grass-dominated fuelbeds are homogeneous. In this study, we sampled fuel moisture from several species in two grassland locations in South Africa to determine (1) if grassland fuels cure differently among species or across locations, (2) whether differences in curing meaningfully affect fire behaviour, and (3) if fuel moisture is associated with soil moisture. Data were characterised by high variability among sampling sites and dates, which highlights the importance of accounting for—rather than averaging out—variation with hierarchical analysis. Variability among locations and species indicates that broad similarities among plant communities do not adequately describe fuelbed dynamics. We observed patterns in the C3Festuca costata that deviated from general patterns in C4 grasses, particularly in grasslands at the edge of environmentally determined transitions. These differences might have landscape-level implications under global environmental change. The temporal breadth and species-level specificity of our study constitute novel data that identify further research to improve the understanding of fuelbed ecology in grasslands worldwide, beyond the context of extreme fire weather and behaviour. Our data suggest that managers in South Africa and abroad should consider heterogeneity within grassland fuelbeds and recognize seasonal changes to ensure that objectives are obtainable ahead of burns, and to explain spatial variation in response within what might have appeared to be a homogeneous grassland fuelbed.},

  abstract = {Forest-savanna mosaics are maintained by fire-mediated positive feedbacks; whereby forest is fire suppressive and savanna is fire promoting. Forest-savanna transitions therefore represent the interface of opposing fire regimes. Within the transition there is a threshold point at which tree canopy cover becomes sufficiently dense to shade out grasses and thus suppress fire. Prior to reaching this threshold, changes in fire behavior may already be occurring within the savanna. Such changes are neither empirically described nor their drivers understood. Fire behavior is largely driven by fuel flammability. Flammability can vary significantly between grass species and grass species composition can change near forest-savanna transitions. This study measured fire behavior changes at eighteen forest-savanna transition sites in a vegetation mosaic in Lopé National Park in Gabon, central Africa. The extent to which these changes could be attributed to changes in grass flammability was determined using species-specific flammability traits. Results showed simultaneous suppression of fire and grass biomass when tree canopy leaf area index (LAI) reached a value of 3, indicating that a fire suppression threshold existed within the forest-savanna transition. Fires became less intense and less hot prior to reaching this fire suppression threshold. These changes were associated with higher LAI values, which induced a change in the grass community, from one dominated by the highly flammable Anadelphia afzeliana to one dominated by the less flammable Hyparrhenia diplandra. Changes in fire behavior were not associated with changes in total grass biomass. This study demonstrated not only the presence of a fire suppression threshold but the mechanism of its action. Grass composition mediated fire-behavior within the savanna prior to reaching the suppression threshold, and grass species composition was mediated by tree canopy cover which was in turn mediated by fire-behavior. These findings highlight how biotic and abiotic controls interact and amplify each other in this mosaicked landscape to facilitate forest and savanna co-existence.},

  abstract = {Plant ecologists have long been interested in the effects of fire on vegetation. Thermocouples have been in their proverbial toolbox for decades, despite temperature not being a direct product or measure of wildland fire behaviour or fire effects. To better represent the cumulative impact of high-temperature exposure on organisms, ecologists often use temperature–time curves from thermocouples to calculate residence time—the duration of heat exposure above a threshold temperature—which can be used to calculate another popular metric, degree  \$\${\textbackslash}cdot \$\$seconds. A systematic literature review of 105 published papers shows that residence time, especially, and degree \$\${\textbackslash}cdot \$\$seconds are common metrics derived from raw temperature–time data. While several errors in thermocouple readings have been previously identified and addressed—responsiveness to heating, discrepancy between thermocouple temperature and actual temperature of the medium surrounding the thermocouple—this paper highlights a previously unconsidered source of error that must be reconciled for metrics like residence time to be biologically valid: the disproportionately long time it takes for thermocouples to cool once heat input is complete. Using an array of thermocouples in a fume hood over a Bunsen burner before and after the flame is extinguished, this paper shows that after being exposed to flame, 30-gauge K-type thermocouples require 80–100 s to register ambient temperatures despite taking only about 5 s to respond to heating. The review indicates ecologists give no consideration for this disproportionately slow cooling response. These findings indicate that residence time (and therefore degree \$\${\textbackslash}cdot \$\$seconds) have been over-estimated in the fire ecology literature. The proposed solution is to simply truncate temperature–time curves at the point temperature begins to decline, which indicates a shift from the biologically relevant effect of heat input to the biologically irrelevant, physical properties (heat diffusivity) of the thermocouple itself. Conceptual models present these biologically relevant portions of the temperature–time curve and identify parts of the biologically relevant curve that might be useful in quantifying components of flammability.},

Cool-season precipitation was 33\% below average in both years of the study, while warm-season precipitation was only slightly below average both years. Standing crop of current year's growth was increased by burning on overflow range sites, but not on silty range sites. Big bluestem (Andropogon gerardi) standing crop was greatest with mid-May burning. Kentucky bluegrass (Poa pratensis) standing crop and leaf length were reduced with burning on both dates. Leaf length, basal area and number of inflorescences of native cool-season grasses were also reduced. Mid-May burning in drought years may be recommended for the reduction of Kentucky bluegrass. However, reductions in production of native cool-season vegetation can be expected on silty range sites. In contrast, mid-June burning in dry years is not recommended.},

  abstract = {Closing the wildland fire heat budget involves characterising the heat source and energy dissipation across the range of variability in fuels and fire behaviour. Meeting this challenge will lay the foundation for predicting direct ecological effects of fires and fire–atmosphere coupling. In this paper, we focus on the relationships between the fire radiation field, as measured from the zenith, fuel consumption and the behaviour of spreading flame fronts. Experiments were conducted in 8 Â 8-m outdoor plots using preconditioned wildland fuels characteristic of mixed-oak forests of the eastern United States. Using dual-band radiometers with a field of view of ,18.5 m2 at a height of 4.2 m, we found a nearlinear increase in fire radiative energy density over a range of fuel consumption between 0.15 and 3.25 kg mÀ2. Using an integrated heat budget, we estimate that the fraction of total theoretical combustion energy density radiated from the plot averaged 0.17, the fraction of latent energy transported in the plume averaged 0.08, and the fraction accounted for by the combination of fire convective energy transport and soil heating averaged 0.72. Future work will require, at minimum, instantaneous and time-integrated estimates of energy transported by radiation, convection and soil heating across a range of fuels.},

  abstract = {A key determinant of wildfire behaviour is the flammability of constituent plants. One plant trait that influences flammability is the retention of dead biomass, as the low moisture content of dead material means less energy is required to achieve combustion. However, the effect of the dead-to-live ratio of fuel on plant flammability has rarely been experimentally quantified. Here we examine the nature of the relationship between dead fuel accumulation and flammability in Ulex europaeus (common gorse). Shoots with varying proportions of dead material were ignited in a purpose-built plant-burner. Three components of flammability were measured: sustainability (flame duration), consumability (proportion burnt biomass) and combustibility (maximum temperature). While flame duration and proportion burnt biomass had a positive linear relationship with the proportion of dead material, the response of maximum temperature was positive but non-linear. All three flammability components were reduced to a single variable using principal components analysis; this had a non-linear relationship with the proportion of dead material. The response of maximum temperature to dead material plateaued at 39\%. These findings have implications for the management of habitats invaded by gorse; to mitigate fire hazard associated with gorse, stands should be kept at a relatively young age when dead fuel is less prevalent.},

The formula and data together determine a numerical representation of the model from which the profiled deviance or the profiled REML criterion can be evaluated as a function of some of the model parameters. The appropriate criterion is optimized, using one of the constrained optimization functions in R, to provide the parameter estimates. We describe the structure of the model, the steps in evaluating the profiled deviance or REML criterion, and the structure of classes or types that represents such a model. Sufficient detail is included to allow specialization of these structures by users who wish to write functions to fit specialized linear mixed models, such as models incorporating pedigrees or smoothing splines, that are not easily expressible in the formula language used by lmer.},

  abstract = {Thermocouple probes have long been standard equipment for wildland fire scientists. But despite substantial advancements in the electronic datalogger technology necessary to read and store data from thermocouples, the effective cost per thermocouple sensor of commercial systems has not decreased such that most researchers can afford to deploy enough sensors to account for the high degree of variability in wildland fire behavior. Because the equipment must endure the extreme conditions of wildland fire, is unlikely that any thermocouple datalogger system will be considered “cheap.” However, the growing number of applications of open-source, do-it-yourself (DIY) microcontroller systems in scientific research suggests these products might be employed in thermocouple datalogging systems if (1) their performance can be shown to be comparable to commercial systems and (2) they can be protected from exposure in the wildland fire environment. In this paper, we compare the performance of an Arduino MEGA microcontroller board relative to a Campbell Scientific CR1000, reading standard K-type metal overbraided ceramic fiber insulated thermocouple probes, under the constant temperature of a drying oven and the variable flame of a Bunsen burner. In both comparisons, we found that the variability among individual thermocouples, which are known to have a \$\${\textbackslash}pm{\textbackslash}, 2{\textbackslash},{\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}circ \}{\textbackslash}hbox \{C\}\{-\}6{\textbackslash},{\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}circ \}{\textbackslash}hbox \{C\}\$\$margin of error, was greater than between the dataloggers. We also describe a compact and mobile Arduino-based system capable of recording wildland fire flame temperatures in agris. In considering these three systems, it is clear that Arduino-based open-source, DIY components can support a compact, low-cost datalogger that accommodates more sensors for lower cost than proprietary commercial systems with no sacrifice in data quality. The combination of low-cost, multi-sensor units can contribute to better understanding of variability in wildland fire behavior.},

  abstract = {The realm of wildland fire science encompasses both wild and prescribed fires. Most of the research in the broader field has focused on wildfires, however, despite the prevalence of prescribed fires and demonstrated need for science to guide its application. We argue that prescribed fire science requires a fundamentally different approach to connecting related disciplines of physical, natural, and social sciences. We also posit that research aimed at questions relevant to prescribed fire will improve overall wildland fire science and stimulate the development of useful knowledge about managed wildfires. Because prescribed fires are increasingly promoted and applied for wildfire management and are intentionally ignited to meet policy and land manager objectives, a broader research agenda incorporating the unique features of prescribed fire is needed. We highlight the primary differences between prescribed fire science and wildfire science in the study of fuels, fire behavior, fire weather, fire effects, and fire social science. Wildfires managed for resource benefits (“managed wildfires”) offer a bridge for linking these science frameworks. A recognition of the unique science needs related to prescribed fire will be key to addressing the global challenge of managing wildland fire for long-term sustainability of natural resources.},

To overcome these limitations, desirable spatial attributes of gridded climate data are combined with desirable temporal attributes of regional-scale reanalysis and daily gauge-based precipitation to derive a spatially and temporally complete, high-resolution (4-km) gridded dataset of surface meteorological variables required in ecological modelling for the contiguous United States from 1979 to 2010. Validation of the resulting gridded surface meteorological data, using an extensive network of automated weather stations across the western United States, showed skill comparable to that derived from interpolation using station observations, suggesting it can serve as suitable surrogate for landscape-scale ecological modelling across vast unmonitored areas of the United States.},
