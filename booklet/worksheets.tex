\chapter{Fire behavior modeling exercise}

The following pages reproduce the necessary pages from the NWCG Fireline Appendix B to complete a Fire Behavior Worksheet (p. B-5) for Grass Fuel Model 1 or 2, on a given set of input parameters either measured or hypothetical for the purpose of the example (dry bulb temperature, relative humidity, wind speed, slope, aspect, fuel shading, etc). 
Although Appendix B Output tables for FM 1-3 are included, nomograms for both low and high windspeeds from \citet{rothermel1983} for FM 1 and 2 are also included.
