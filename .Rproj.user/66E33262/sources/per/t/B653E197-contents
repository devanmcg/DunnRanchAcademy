# Summary 

## Background

* Fracking would bring new technologies--and impacts--to South Africa
* Several applications for shale gas exploration have been made in South Africa over the last 10 years
* Environmental Assessments and most public interest have focused on the Karoo, but recent exploration applications were filed for eastern SA
